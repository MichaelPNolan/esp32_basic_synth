# esp32_basic_synth - the Michael Nolan implementation

ESP32 based simple synthesizer project
Fork here is by Michael Nolan - enormous gratitude to project originator. Homage, this I'm forking for my own learning to use Github and work on it from other places.

The project can be seen in Marcel-License video https://youtu.be/5XVK5MOKmZw

--- This text is from Marcel but I'm going to change a lot of this ... to match my variation if necessary.
The project has been tested on
- ESP32 Dev Kit - generic
- ESP32 DEVKIT - DOIT v1
- 
// Untested even though I do own one. I wanted to make inexpensive hacked kiddies toys with real synthizer and or midi capabilities.

# ESP32 Audio Kit V2.2
To compile set board to: ESP32 Dev Module
Ensure "#define ESP32_AUDIO_KIT" is set in config.h
IO22 will be used for MIDI in.

The ADC multiplexer can be used (other wise please remove #define ADC_TO_MIDI_ENABLED from config.h)
Connection of the ADC multiplexer:
- EN -> Ground
- S0 -> IO23
- S1 -> IO18
- S2 -> IO14
- S3 -> Ground
- Sig -> IO12

# ESP32 DEVKIT - DOIT
To compile set the board to: DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1
Ensure that "#define ESP32_AUDIO_KIT" has been removed from config.h

I've tried 3 DACs all PCM5102 - so far. One was broken by me or DOA, but this one (as seen here https://blog.himbeer.me/2018/12/27/how-to-connect-a-pcm5102-i2s-dac-to-your-raspberry-pi/). Works and so does this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbaYVh3mIws (which I can recommend as the easiest to get up and running).
I've ordered several others to test with  this later one uses 5v and has 3.3v regulators - several. I isolated it from the earth with a 0505 power isolation supply. I have another project which I didn't do that but it's all soldered together and it doesn't have the buzz from the microcontroller noise on it's earth - possibly because i've got bypass and star ground.

## Using a DAC
An external audio DAC is recommended for this setup:
- BCLK -> IO25
- WLCK -> IO27
- DOUT -> IO26

//I haven't tried this - why am I such an idiot that I didn't even read this properly.
## Using no DAC
You can also get a sound without a DAC.
Add '#define I2S_NODAC' to config.h

The default output pin is IO22. Add a capacitor in series of the audio line (10ÂµF for example)

I've butchered this code and put a simple ADC for a pot, and i've also used a multiplexer chip on a Midicontroller - so I haven't used this yet in my version here but the code is sort of in play. However, I discovered that if you initialize thie ADCmul parts of this project then ADC via pins of the ESP32 seemed to read wrong (not work) - there is also an issue with code from 1.0.4 of the ESP32 for Arduino board libraries being needed and so newer versions will have compile errors and there are analog related calls that don't exist since 1.0.5 where they just standardized to the arduino way of calling those.
## Using an ADC multiplexer  - This part you may want to go back to the original this is forked from
Connection of the ADC multiplexer:
- EN -> Ground
- S0 -> IO33
- S1 -> IO32
- S2 -> IO13
- S3 -> Ground
- Sig -> IO12

##NOTES on changes to the ADC_Module
In my project I didn't set up this chip but I did ADC direct to pins of ESP32 dev board and
i developed different variations of filtering noise and over-sampling. However - then I pivoted to working with USB Midi controller
and built on pots and sliders - making my own mapping for a Worlde Tuna Mini

## SSD1306 OLED Display - main feature of this fork
Primary benefit is to have feedback on notes and parameters and turn off serial communications used with the ArduinoIDE serial monitor.
Code originally calling that is optioned out with #ifdef DISPLAY_1306 #endif using #else to call the original serial for debugging.
This chip drivers - from what I've seen monochrome tiny displays as in old phone equipment. Its very light on power of course
There is a 128x32 thin shallow version (that I used in my stand-alone synth) and the 128x64. I created code to write parameter name strings
and overlay a bar that adjust as you turn the knob. 
Later I optimized the code to make use of infrequent refresh to clean up the animation about 12 fps so you can see mention of refresh rate.
This is merely how many times a second we clear and rewrite the screen contents. That way I can just write only the changed strings/bars and reduce processing and communication overhead when the knobs are sending a lot of control changes. When it was doing to many I would hear audible noise as the I2S got delayed putting samples to the buffer. The OLED driver is setup using Core0 (whereas the i2s and processing audio samples is on the default Core1)

### ADC Mapping
The adc module has been only tested with the ESP32 Audio Kit V2.2.
In z_config.ino you can define your own mapping. Actually only 8 channels are read from the multiplexer.
The adc lookup is used to define a channel and cc per analog input (C0..C7).
By changing adc values a MIDI messages will generated internally.
It should be also mapped int the MIDI mapping.

# MIDI Mapping
A controller mapping can be found in z_config.ino.
You can define your own controller mapping if your controller does support CC messages.

## MIDI via USB - This fork uses hostmidi shield
https://www.lazada.co.th/products/mini-usb-host-shield-20-adk-slr-development-tool-i2518678308-s8940605238.html?spm=a2o4m.searchlist.list.5.3b4b2c55rk7xxJ&search=1
MIDI can be received via USB activating the MACRO "MIDI_VIA_USB_ENABLED" in config.h.

Default PIN Mapping is:
- CS: IO5
- INT: IO17 (not used)
- SCK: IO18
- MISO: IO19
- MOSI: IO23
